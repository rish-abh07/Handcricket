# 🏏 Hand Cricket Game – Web Version (C + Raylib + Emscripten)

A fully playable Hand Cricket game built in **C** using **Raylib**, compiled to the **web** using **Emscripten**. This project recreates the nostalgic childhood game of Hand Cricket with animations, sound, score tracking, and full match flow — all inside the browser!

## 📚 What I Learned

> This project marks a big milestone in my learning journey.

I started this project to learn C with a practical purpose. Coming from a game development background, I wanted to move away from Unity and try building something from scratch. Inspired by Zomato's ZPL, I initially created a terminal-based version and later moved to a full graphical game using Raylib.

I chose **Raylib** over SDL2 for its simplicity and clarity. Although the project is still evolving, it helped me learn end-to-end game development — from raw C to WebAssembly and deployment.

### 🔧 Technical Learnings
- Modular C with header/source structure
- Game loop and screen state handling
- Texture rendering and animation with Raylib
- Compiling C to WebAssembly using Emscripten
- Deploying via GitHub + Netlify CI/CD
- Debugging browser-side JS/C integrations

### 💡 Web Dev Learnings
- Building a responsive canvas layout
- Adding Google AdSense
- Hosting with Netlify
- Writing clean HTML/CSS for native apps

## 🧠 Future Plans
- Add sound effects & ambient music
- Wicket animations (bowled out, catch, etc.)
- Multiplayer (hotseat)
- Save scores using localStorage or backend
- Gameplay stats dashboard
